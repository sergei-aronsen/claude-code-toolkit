## [Unreleased]

## [4.9.0] - 2026-05-02

Major install UX overhaul on top of 4.8.x — focused on PR #28 install run on
macOS and a series of user reports between 2026-05-01 and 2026-05-02.

Phases 32-35 (Integrations Catalog) consolidated v4.9 around a unified
MCP + companion-CLI install page. See [docs/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md)
for the full reference.

### Added — Integrations Catalog (Phases 32-35)

Unified MCP + CLI install page accessible via `--integrations` (or the
deprecated `--mcps` alias). Replaces the old MCP-only page.

- **20 MCP servers across 10 categories** — `docs-research`, `backend`,
  `payments`, `email`, `workspace`, `project-management`, `communication`,
  `design`, `dev-tools`, `monitoring`. The TUI groups entries by category
  in canonical order; categories with zero entries silently skip.
- **8 companion CLIs** — install the official command-line tool for the
  same vendor alongside the MCP server. Cross-platform via `uname -s`
  dispatch (`brew install` on Darwin, vendor user-space tarball or
  `npm install -g` on Linux). NEVER auto-prefixes `sudo`. Brew-absent on
  Darwin yields a single-line hint and rc=3 — toolkit never auto-installs
  Homebrew.
- **Per-component status detection** — TUI shows `[MCP:✓ CLI:—]` per
  row (✓ installed, ✗ absent, ⊘ unknown, — n/a). MCP probe via
  `claude mcp list` (cached once per shell, ~4s); CLI probe via
  `command -v` (sub-millisecond, no cache).
- **`unofficial: true` confirm gate** — community / browser-automation
  entries (`notebooklm`, `telegram`) get a yellow `!` glyph in the TUI
  and a `[y/N]` confirm prompt before install. Default N (fail-closed
  per UN-03 contract). `--yes` does NOT bypass this prompt — security
  boundary. `ALWAYS_YES=1` env override bypasses (trusted automation).
- **`--mcp-only` / `--cli-only` mutex flags** — install only the MCP side
  or only the CLI side of selected entries. Mutually exclusive (passing
  both exits with rc=2 + stderr "mutually exclusive").
- **Closing summary table** — Entry × MCP × CLI matrix with per-component
  glyphs, Notes column for skip reasons, and `Installed: N MCPs, M CLIs ·
  Skipped: X · Failed: Y` total line.

### Added — 12 new integrations (INT-01..12)

- **Backend**: `supabase` (MCP+CLI), `cloudflare` (MCP+wrangler),
  `aws-cost-explorer` (MCP+`aws`), `aws-cloudwatch-logs` (MCP+shared
  `aws` CLI — installer detects shared dependency, installs `aws` once
  per session)
- **Payments**: `stripe` (MCP+CLI)
- **Project Management**: `youtrack`, `linear`, `jira` (MCP only)
- **Design**: `figma` (MCP only)
- **Communication**: `slack` (MCP), `telegram` (MCP, unofficial)
- **Docs/Research**: `notebooklm` (MCP, unofficial)

### Added — CLI installer library (`scripts/lib/cli-installer.sh`)

Public primitives consumed by the integrations TUI dispatch loop:

- `cli_detect <name>` — `command -v` wrapper, no caching, sub-millisecond.
- `cli_install <name> <darwin_cmd> <linux_cmd>` — `uname -s` dispatch
  with `TK_CLI_UNAME` test seam. Brew-absent fallback (rc=3) on Darwin
  via `TK_CLI_BREW_BIN` seam. NO sudo auto-prefix EVER (D-17). Trusts
  the curated catalog input (validator-enforced shape) so `eval` is
  safe inside that boundary.
- `cli_post_install_hint <hint>` — writes `→ Next: <hint>` to stderr
  ONLY (stdout stays parseable). Toolkit NEVER auto-runs `<tool> login`
  — boundary is "config + hints", not "auth flows".

### Added — Schema validator + 3 hermetic test suites

- **Validator** `scripts/validate-integrations-catalog.py` (Python stdlib
  only, no `jsonschema` dependency, Python 3.8+). Wired into `make
  validate-catalog` and CI's `validate-templates` job.
- **Test 45** `scripts/tests/test-integrations-catalog.sh` (PASS=14,
  floor 10): schema-only checks for catalog file — `schema_version=2`,
  10 categories, 20 MCP entries, 8 CLI entries, required fields,
  unofficial set is exactly `{notebooklm, telegram}`, no
  `sequential-thinking`, no `sudo` token in any install string.
- **Test 46** `scripts/tests/test-cli-installer.sh` (PASS=24, floor 8):
  primitives test for `cli_detect` / `cli_install` / `cli_post_install_hint`
  with `TK_CLI_UNAME` + `TK_CLI_BREW_BIN` seams.
- **Test 47** `scripts/tests/test-integrations-tui.sh` (PASS=36,
  floor 15): Phase 34 TUI redesign assertions — category-grouped
  rendering, unofficial glyph, parallel-array length, mocked claude
  flow, `unofficial_confirm` ALWAYS_YES + TTY paths,
  `--mcp-only`/`--cli-only` mutex, summary table format, zero-entry
  category skip via fixture catalog.

### Added — `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`

Complete catalog reference with category-grouped tables, install flow,
unofficial semantics, OAuth setup links per entry, troubleshooting, and
a dedicated **Global vs per-project** section establishing the
toolkit/SDK boundary (DOCS-02): catalog ships globals only, never
per-project SDKs.

### Changed — Schema migration (CAT-01..03)

- `scripts/lib/mcp-catalog.json` → `scripts/lib/integrations-catalog.json`
  (`schema_version: 2`). New top-level structure: `categories[]`,
  `components.mcp{}`, `components.cli{}`. 8 surviving Phase 32 entries
  (`context7`, `firecrawl`, `magic`, `notion`, `openrouter`, `playwright`,
  `resend`, `sentry`) tagged with category. Optional CLI blocks added to
  `firecrawl`, `playwright`, `sentry` whose CLIs add real value.
- `scripts/lib/mcp.sh` rewritten to read schema v2 — `mcp_catalog_load`,
  `mcp_categories_load`, `mcp_status_array`, `_mcp_category_display`,
  `unofficial_confirm`, `print_integrations_summary`. Bash 3.2 parallel
  arrays only (`MCP_NAMES[]`, `MCP_CATEGORY[]`, `MCP_UNOFFICIAL[]`,
  `TUI_GROUPS[]`, etc.).
- `scripts/install.sh` adds `--integrations`, `--mcp-only`, `--cli-only`,
  `--mcps` (deprecated alias) flags + dispatch loop with per-row
  unofficial-confirm gate, MCP-side dispatch, CLI-side dispatch via
  `cli_install`, summary table renderer.

### Changed — `--mcps` flag deprecated

`--mcps` continues to work as an alias for `--integrations` but prints a
one-line stderr deprecation note: `⚠ --mcps is deprecated; use
--integrations (alias retained until v6.0)`. Alias removal is post-v5.0.

### Changed — `manifest.json` 4.8.0 → 4.9.0

`files.libs[]` registers `cli-installer.sh` and `integrations-catalog.json`
(replacing `mcp-catalog.json`); `files.scripts[]` registers
`validate-integrations-catalog.py`. `update-claude.sh` auto-discovers
all three via the existing v4.4 LIB-01 D-07 jq path — no script code
changes required for smart-update coverage.

### Changed — `init-claude.sh --version` parity with `init-local.sh`

Added `--version` / `-v` flag to `init-claude.sh` deriving version from
manifest at runtime (v4.3 D-22 contract). Reads local manifest when run
from a clone; curls `$REPO_URL/manifest.json` when run via `curl | bash`.
Both installers now print `claude-code-toolkit v4.9.0` on `--version`.

### Removed — `sequential-thinking` (DROP-01)

Removed from catalog. Native Claude extended thinking covers the use case
adequately. Existing user installs are unaffected — toolkit doesn't
auto-uninstall MCPs when the catalog drops them (boundary preserved).
Users with `sequential-thinking` in their `claude mcp list` keep the
server registered until they manually `claude mcp remove sequential-thinking`.

### Migration notes

Users on v4.8 → v4.9: re-run `update-claude.sh` to pick up the new lib,
script, and JSON catalog. No manual catalog re-fetch needed; the
v4.4 LIB-01 D-07 jq-path auto-discovery handles all three.

### Added — Back navigation in multi-step picker flow (UX-FLOW-02)

Press `b` (or `B`) inside the skills or MCP sub-picker to return to the
previous step. Skills picker → main TUI; MCP picker → skills picker (or
main TUI if skills wasn't selected). Previously selected items are
re-checked when re-entering a picker via Back. Gated on
`TK_TUI_ALLOW_BACK=1`. Footer hint shows `· b back` only in multi-step mode.

### Added — MCP secrets deferred (registered without API key during install)

Mid-install API-key prompts caused users to abandon the flow. New
`TK_MCP_DEFER_SECRETS=1` mode (default during dispatch): MCPs needing env
keys are registered with `claude mcp add` *without* env vars (so they
appear in `claude mcp list` with empty env binding), keys queued in
`~/.claude/mcp-config.env` as empty stubs (mode 0600), and a one-time
shell-rc auto-source line is appended to `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bash_profile` /
`~/.bashrc` (idempotent via marker comment). User fills mcp-config.env,
opens fresh terminal, launches claude — MCPs pick up keys at startup.
No re-registration when keys change later.

Status row reads `installed (needs API key)` (yellow). Post-summary
follow-up block prints a 3-step recipe.

### Added — Tooltip / banner colors switched to CYAN

Sweep `${BLUE}` → `${CYAN}` across `init-claude.sh`, `install.sh`,
`init-local.sh`, `update-claude.sh`. Dark-blue text was unreadable on
macOS Terminal default dark theme.

### Changed — Atomic TUI render eliminates flicker AND bleed-through

`_tui_render` builds the entire frame as a single string and writes to
the TTY in ONE printf. Solves both flicker (per-line printfs caused
visible repaints between syscalls) and bleed-through (gap lines retained
content from prior frames). Atomic write + `\e[H\e[J` at frame start.

### Changed — Install order: skills BEFORE mcp-servers

`TK_DISPATCH_ORDER` reordered so the MCP "needs API key" follow-up block
ends the screen. Main TUI marketplace section + pre-collection sub-pickers
also reordered.

### Changed — Skills install summary uses soft-checkmark style

Bright-green right-aligned `installed ✓` rows replaced with a leading
`✓ name` row (matching `init-claude.sh`'s "📥 Framework extras..." style).
Failures render `✗ name — reason` in red. Dry-run keeps the literal
`would-install` token (tests parse it).

### Changed — Consolidated install finale at top-level

Sub-installers run with `TK_DISPATCHED=1` and suppress their standalone
finale (recommend_security/statusline/optional_plugins, "Verify",
"Restart Claude Code", POST_INSTALL note). Parent `install.sh` emits ONE
consolidated finale AFTER all dispatchers complete.

### Changed — Project-local skill stubs deduplicated against marketplace

Removed `ai-models`, `tailwind`, `i18n` from every framework template
(base + nodejs + go + python + laravel + rails + nextjs). Each
`skill-rules.json` updated. ~4685 lines deleted. Marketplace versions
(`ai-models`, `tailwind-design-system`, `i18n-localization`) cover the
same ground. Kept project-local stubs unique to the toolkit:
`api-design`, `council-integration`, `database`, `debugging`, `docker`,
`llm-patterns`, `observability`, `testing`.

### Fixed — Esc detection on macOS Terminal / iTerm2

`tui_checklist` case match extended from `$'\e')` to
`$'\e' | $'\e\e' | $'\e\e\e')`. macOS Terminal + iTerm2 "Send +Esc"
config emits 2-3 bytes per Esc keypress; the read-ahead window catches
them. Previous single-arm match dropped these into `*) ignore` and
"Esc did nothing". Footer text changed `Esc cancel` → `Ctrl+C abort`.

### Fixed — `claude mcp list` cached once per install

`mcp_status_array` previously called `claude mcp list` 9 times (once per
MCP catalog entry) for ~40 s on macOS. New `_mcp_list_cache_init`
function memoizes once per shell. Visible "Loading MCP catalog..."
banner added.

### Fixed — Sub-pickers run in main process (no subshell)

UX-FLOW-01 originally captured sub-picker output via subshell `$()`.
On macOS the TUI library's stty/cursor-hide sequences plus captured-stdout
fd combination left the post-Submit screen frozen. Sub-pickers now run
in the main process with `_save_main_tui_state` / `_restore_main_tui_state`
helpers.

### Fixed — Mid-install banner suppressed in dispatch mode

`init-claude.sh` invoked from `install.sh` dispatch loop printed its
standalone "Installation Complete!" + recommendations block BEFORE
skills/MCP dispatchers ran. `TK_DISPATCHED=1` suppresses it.

### Fixed — `mcp-catalog.json` race-on-mktemp

`--mcps` branch unconditionally re-`mktemp`'d a catalog file even when
the parent UX-FLOW-01 block already exported `TK_MCP_CATALOG_PATH`.
Under heavy `/tmp` churn BSD `mkstemp` gave up with `File exists`.
Guard added.

### Fixed — `gemini-bridge` symlink failure message

Two-line message replaced with 5-line diagnostic naming the symlink
target, explaining *why* we refuse (could clobber another tool's config),
and printing the literal `rm <path>` command to fix it.

### Changed — Pre-collect all TUI selections before installing (UX-FLOW-01)

Previously the install flow was: main TUI → Submit → run toolkit / security /
etc. → 20 s pause → MCP sub-picker → Submit → install MCPs → skills sub-picker
→ Submit → install skills. The mid-install sub-pickers felt like a hang and
broke the user's mental model of "answer questions, then watch the install".

New flow: main TUI → Submit → MCP sub-picker (if `mcp-servers` row checked)
→ Submit → skills sub-picker (if `skills` row checked) → Submit → THEN the
dispatch loop runs end-to-end with no further prompts.

Implementation: `install.sh` collects MCP / skills selections in subshells
(so the main TUI globals aren't clobbered) right after the bridge plumbing
block. Selections are exported as `TK_MCP_PRE_SELECTED` / `TK_SKILLS_PRE_SELECTED`
comma-separated lists. The `--mcps` and `--skills` branches honour these
env vars: when set (even empty), they skip their own TUI render and build
`TUI_RESULTS` directly from the pre-collected list. Empty value (`TK_MCP_PRE_SELECTED=""`)
is meaningful — "user opened the picker, picked nothing, hit Submit" — and
results in a headless install of zero items rather than falling back to a
TUI that would reopen mid-install.

Cancel semantics preserved: pressing Esc / Ctrl-C in the MCP or skills sub-
picker aborts the entire install (no partial component install).

New regression test `scripts/tests/test-flow-prequestions.sh` (8/8 PASS):
asserts pre-selected env produces exactly the named items, empty env produces
zero items, and unset env falls back to the legacy `--yes` default-set path.

### Fixed — Invisible-prompt regression (TUI dispatch)

After a user pressed Submit on the main TUI, `init-claude.sh` ran under
`install.sh`'s D-28 stderr-capture wrapper (`( dispatch_toolkit ) 2>"$tmp"`).
Bash's `read -p "prompt"` writes the prompt to **stderr**, so the bridge
install prompt (`Gemini detected. Create GEMINI.md → CLAUDE.md bridge?
[Y/n]:`) landed in the captured tmpfile and the user saw a bare blinking
caret with no instruction.

Two-layer fix:

1. **Structural:** new `tui_tty_read` helper in `scripts/lib/tui.sh` writes
   the prompt directly to the TTY device (not stderr), immune to parent
   stderr capture. Refactored 5 call sites — `lib/tui.sh:tui_confirm_prompt`,
   `lib/bridges.sh` × 2 (drift overwrite, install prompt),
   `lib/bootstrap.sh:_bootstrap_prompt_and_run`, `lib/mcp.sh` × 2 (overwrite,
   secret-key entry). Helper supports a `TK_TUI_PROMPT_SINK` regression-test
   seam and char-device detection so legacy regular-file / process-
   substitution test seams continue to work without truncating answers.
2. **UX:** `install.sh` plumbs the TUI bridge selection (rows 8/9) into
   `init-claude.sh` via `BRIDGES_FORCE` / `TK_NO_BRIDGES` env vars. When the
   user selects bridges in the main TUI, `bridge_install_prompts` takes its
   non-interactive force path (no second prompt). When the user leaves the
   bridge rows unchecked, `TK_NO_BRIDGES=1` silences project-bridge prompts
   entirely. Manual `--bridges <list>` / `--no-bridges` overrides still work
   when invoked outside the TUI flow.

`tui.sh` is now downloaded by `init-claude.sh` and `update-claude.sh` BEFORE
`bridges.sh` / `bootstrap.sh` / `mcp.sh` so their lazy-source guard
(`command -v tui_tty_read`) reports defined and the per-lib `BASH_SOURCE`
fallback (which fails under curl|bash because libs live in `/tmp/<lib>`
without sibling files) is skipped.

New regression test `scripts/tests/test-invisible-prompt.sh` (14/14 PASS):
asserts prompts never reach captured stderr, exercises both the helper unit
and the real bridge / mcp paths under a stderr-capture wrapper. All existing
suites still pass (test-bridges-sync 25/0, test-mcp-secrets 11/0,
test-bridges-install-ux 20/0, test-bootstrap 26/0, test-install-tui 52/0).

### Audit Sweep 260430-go5 (PR #15) — 18 findings + dead-code

Deep 4-agent audit (security, code-review, infra/CI, shell) on 2026-04-30.
1 finding withdrawn as false positive (Read-tool render artifact). Cross-checked
against parallel Gemini audit which caught 1 additional dead-code item.

#### Fixed — High

- **H1** — `install.sh` dispatch index mismatch installed wrong bridge under
  Codex-only scenario (`IS_GEM=0 IS_COD=1`). Now uses name-based lookup with
  `_local_label_to_dispatch_name()` helper. New regression test
  `scripts/tests/test-install-dispatch-h1.sh` (6/6 PASS).
- **H3** — `setup-security.sh` silently skipped RTK.md install under
  `bash <(curl ...)` because `dirname $0` resolved to `/dev/fd`. Curl-pipe
  detection added with download fallback.
- **H4** — `init-claude.sh` echoed Gemini/OpenAI/OpenRouter API keys to terminal
  scrollback (`read -r -p`). Switched 3 sites to `read -rs -p` matching the
  hardened `setup-council.sh` pattern.
- **H5** — Distribution chain hardcoded to mutable `main` ref. New
  `TK_TOOLKIT_REF` env var (default `main`) on all 8 installers +
  `lib/dispatch.sh`. Documented in `docs/INSTALL.md`. Optional
  `TK_TOOLKIT_PIN_SHA256` checksum mode deferred.
- **H6** — `TK_DISPATCH_OVERRIDE_*` env-bash without `TK_TEST=1` gate while
  `eval` siblings already gated by audit C2. Gate parity restored across 6
  dispatchers + 7 test blocks.

#### Fixed — Medium

- **M1** — `install.sh:837` called undefined `log_error` → exit 127 if
  validator triggered. Inlined the error echo.
- **M2** — `uninstall.sh` reclassified empty-installed-sha files from
  `MODIFIED` to `REMOVE` so users no longer get spurious `[y/N/d]` prompts on
  toolkit-owned files they never edited.
- **M3** — Trap regression of audit M6 fix in `propagate-audit-pipeline-v42.sh`
  (line 300) and `lib/bootstrap.sh` (line 67). Now uses `printf %q` quoting
  matching the corrected pattern at `propagate-audit-pipeline-v42.sh:128`.
- **M4** — `install.sh:917,920` empty-array expansion crashed under Bash 3.2
  `set -u`. Switched to `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` form matching siblings 363/365.
- **M5** — `setup-council.sh:512` `read /dev/tty` killed installer under
  `set -e` with no TTY. Added `|| true` guard matching every other `read`
  in the repo.
- **M6** — `update-claude.sh:1129/1211/1212` bare `mktemp` calls leaked on
  SIGINT — registered to EXIT trap.
- **M7** — `.github/workflows/quality.yml` added `concurrency:`
  cancel-in-progress group; force-push no longer spawns redundant 5-job runs.
- **M8** — `templates/global/statusline.sh` and `rate-limit-probe.sh` now
  early-exit on non-Darwin platforms (BSD-only `stat -f %m` was silently
  misbehaving on Linux).

#### Fixed — Low

- **L1** — `mcp_secrets_load` validates key shape (`^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$`)
  alongside values.
- **L2** — `install.sh` removed component name from `/tmp` stderr templates
  (3 sites — line 892 also leaked); now mktemp randomness only.
- **L3** — `lib/skills.sh:147` `rm -rf` guarded against `/` and empty target.
- **L4** — Browser `User-Agent` added to all `curl` invocations (project
  global rule §2 violation). New `TK_USER_AGENT` constant in 3 libs +
  inline `-A` injection across 13 scripts. 17 files touched.
- **L5** — `scripts/council/brain.py` sanitizes ANSI/control chars from
  reviewer output before writing to disk (3 sites including `missed_text`).
  Pattern copied from `update-claude.sh:1005-1008`.

#### Withdrawn — false positive

- **H2** — `lib/mcp.sh:85` claimed empty join separator. `xxd` confirmed the
  literal `\x1f` (ASCII 31 unit-separator) byte was already present; Read-tool
  renderer displayed US byte as nothing, fooling the audit agent. Source code
  was correct.

#### Dead code

- **T1** — Removed unused `sha256_any()` helper from
  `scripts/tests/test-uninstall-prompt.sh:65-72` (caught by parallel Gemini
  cross-audit).

## [4.8.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Multi-CLI Bridge

- **CLI detection** (`scripts/lib/detect2.sh`) — BRIDGE-DET-01, BRIDGE-DET-02,
  BRIDGE-DET-03: Phase 28. `is_gemini_installed` and `is_codex_installed` probes
  added alongside the existing 6 binary probes from v4.6 Phase 24. Both return
  0/1 binary, fail-soft via `command -v <cli>` with `[ -d ~/.gemini/ ]` /
  `[ -d ~/.codex/ ]` as soft cross-check. `detect2_cache` exports `IS_GEM` and
  `IS_COD`.

- **Bridge generation library** (`scripts/lib/bridges.sh`, 467 lines) —
  BRIDGE-GEN-01, BRIDGE-GEN-02, BRIDGE-GEN-03, BRIDGE-GEN-04: Phase 28.
  `bridge_create_project <target>` writes
  `<project>/GEMINI.md` (gemini) or `<project>/AGENTS.md` (codex) — note this
  is the OpenAI standard, NOT `CODEX.md`. `bridge_create_global <target>` writes
  `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` / `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and never touches the canonical
  `CLAUDE.md`. Auto-generated header banner is byte-identical across all
  bridges. Each bridge registers in `~/.claude/toolkit-install.json::bridges[]`
  with `target`, `path`, `scope`, `source_sha256`, `bridge_sha256`,
  `user_owned: false`. Atomic state writes via `tempfile.mkstemp + os.replace`.

- **Sync on update** (`scripts/update-claude.sh`) — BRIDGE-SYNC-01, BRIDGE-SYNC-02,
  BRIDGE-SYNC-03: Phase 29.
  `sync_bridges()` iterates `bridges[]` from state file. Source-drift detection
  (recorded `source_sha256` differs from current) triggers re-copy and SHA
  refresh, logging `[~ UPDATE] GEMINI.md`. Bridge-drift detection (user edited
  the bridge file) triggers `[y/N/d]` prompt with default `N`; `d` shows diff
  and re-prompts (mirrors v4.3 UN-03 contract). Orphaned source (CLAUDE.md
  deleted) logs `[? ORPHANED]` and auto-flips `user_owned: true`.

- **Break/restore bridges** (`scripts/update-claude.sh`) — BRIDGE-SYNC-02:
  Phase 29. `--break-bridge <target>` flips `user_owned: true` for the named
  bridge; subsequent updates skip it with `[- SKIP]`. `--restore-bridge <target>`
  reverses the flag and resumes sync on next update.

- **Uninstall integration** (`scripts/uninstall.sh`) — BRIDGE-UN-01, BRIDGE-UN-02:
  Phase 29. Bridges from `bridges[]` are classified via `classify_bridge_file`
  helper: clean → REMOVE_LIST; user-modified → MODIFIED_LIST with v4.3 `[y/N/d]`
  prompt. `is_protected_path` correctly bypassed for bridges. `--keep-state`
  (v4.4 KEEP-01) preserves `bridges[]` entries alongside the rest of
  toolkit-install.json — no special-case handling needed.

- **Install-time UX** (`scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/init-claude.sh`,
  `scripts/init-local.sh`) — BRIDGE-UX-01, BRIDGE-UX-02, BRIDGE-UX-03,
  BRIDGE-UX-04: Phase 30. The unified TUI
  (`install.sh`) shows conditional `gemini-bridge` / `codex-bridge` rows in
  the Components page when the corresponding CLI is detected; rows hidden
  otherwise. `init-claude.sh` and `init-local.sh` post-install per-CLI prompt
  defaulting `Y`, fail-closed `N` on no-TTY (CI / piped install). All 3 entry
  points support `--no-bridges` / `TK_NO_BRIDGES=1` (skip) and `--bridges
  gemini,codex` (force-create non-interactively). With `--fail-fast`, absent
  CLI exits 1; without, warns and continues.

- **Multi-CLI bridge documentation** (`docs/BRIDGES.md`, `docs/INSTALL.md`,
  `README.md`) — BRIDGE-DOCS-01, BRIDGE-DOCS-02: Phase 31. New `docs/BRIDGES.md` documents
  supported CLIs (Gemini → `GEMINI.md`, OpenAI Codex → `AGENTS.md`),
  plain-copy semantics, drift handling, opt-out (`--no-bridges`,
  `--break-bridge`, `--restore-bridge`), force-create (`--bridges <list>`),
  symlink-vs-copy rationale, uninstall behaviour, future scope. `INSTALL.md`
  Installer Flags table extended with 4 new flag rows. `README.md` Killer
  Features grid mentions multi-CLI bridges.

- **Manifest registration** (`manifest.json`) — BRIDGE-DIST-01: Phase 31.
  `scripts/lib/bridges.sh` added to `files.libs[]` (alphabetized between
  `bootstrap.sh` and `cli-recommendations.sh`). Auto-discovered by
  `update-claude.sh` via the v4.4 LIB-01 D-07 jq path with zero code changes.

### Changed

- **`write_state` arity extended** (`scripts/lib/state.sh`) — Phase 29 D-29-01
  backward-compatible 10-arg variant accepts `bridges_json` as the 10th
  positional. Existing 9-arg callers (`init-claude.sh`, `update-claude.sh`,
  `install.sh`) work unchanged via Bash positional-default semantics.
  `init-local.sh` and `migrate-to-complement.sh` updated to pass the 10th arg.

- **Manifest version** bumped from 4.6.0 to 4.7.0. All 3 plugin manifests
  (`tk-skills`, `tk-commands`, `tk-framework-rules`) bumped in lock-step.

### Fixed

- **Phase 29 WR-01** — uninstall `[y/N/d]` bypass for user-modified bridges
  fixed by routing through existing v4.3 prompt path instead of skipping.

- **Phase 29 WR-02** — state file path mismatch in test fixtures (was using
  `STATE_FILE_HOME` instead of `TK_BRIDGE_HOME`) corrected; all hermetic tests
  now run in fully isolated sandboxes.

- **Phase 30 WR-01** — silent `--bridges <list>` failure when named CLI absent
  without `--fail-fast` now prints a warning to stderr and continues.

### Tests

- 3 new hermetic suites totalling 50 assertions:
  - `scripts/tests/test-bridges-foundation.sh` (5 assertions, Phase 28)
  - `scripts/tests/test-bridges-sync.sh` (25 assertions, Phase 29)
  - `scripts/tests/test-bridges-install-ux.sh` (20 assertions, Phase 30)
- `scripts/tests/test-bridges.sh` (NEW) — aggregator wrapping the 3 suites
  with a single PASS/FAIL summary; wired into CI (`quality.yml`
  test-init-script job).

### Compatibility

- BACKCOMPAT-01 preserved across all v4.6 baselines:
  - `test-bootstrap.sh` PASS=26 unchanged
  - `test-install-tui.sh` PASS=43 unchanged
  - All 7 v4.3 uninstall-suite tests unchanged
  - All v4.6 MCP / Skills / Marketplace tests unchanged

## [4.7.0] - 2026-04-29

### Phase 24 Sub-Phases 2–10 — Council rework

#### Added — Sub-Phase 2 (editable system prompts)

- Externalized Skeptic / Pragmatist / audit-review system prompts to
  `~/.claude/council/prompts/*.md`. brain.py reads them via `load_prompt()`
  and falls back to embedded constants when files are missing.
- Mandatory FP-recheck + Confidence triad + code citation block in every
  verdict per the new prompt template.
- `.upstream-new.md` sidecar pattern preserves user edits on update,
  mirroring `setup-security.sh`.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 3 (context enrichment + redaction)

- Context bundle now includes README head, `.planning/PROJECT.md`,
  recent git log, TODO/FIXME grep, and matching test files for any
  source files Gemini selects in discovery.
- `apply_context_budget()` proportional truncation guards a 200K total
  context cap.
- `redact_context()` strips Stripe live keys, Anthropic `sk-ant-`,
  generic high-entropy hex, and `.env` quoted secrets before sending.
  Patterns live in editable `~/.claude/council/redaction-patterns.txt`.
- `COUNCIL_DEBUG=1` stderr trace shows context block sizes + redaction
  counts.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 4 (cost tracking)

- Append-only `~/.claude/council/usage.jsonl` log of every Council call
  with provider, model, mode, tokens, dollar cost, and verdict.
- `pricing.json` overlays a built-in `DEFAULT_PRICING` table; CLI
  providers cost $0 with chars/4 estimated tokens marked
  `estimated: true`.
- New `/council-stats` slash command renders `--day | --week | --month
  | --total | --since/--until | --csv` summaries from the log.
- Optional `COUNCIL_COST_CONFIRM_THRESHOLD=<usd>` cost gate prompts the
  user before any call whose estimated input cost exceeds the threshold;
  CI / non-TTY runs auto-proceed with stderr warning.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 5 (provider hardening + fallback)

- Codex CLI provider for ChatGPT (mode: cli) using `codex exec --model
  X --config model_reasoning_effort=Y -`.
- `reasoning.effort` pinned to `high` for the gpt-5.2 / o3 family
  (configurable via `config.openai.reasoning_effort`).
- Gemini `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget=32768` set for the API path.
- OpenRouter free-model fallback chain (`tencent/hy3-preview:free`,
  `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free`,
  `inclusionai/ling-2.6-1t:free`, `openrouter/free`) kicks in when the
  primary backend errors. Recorded with `fallback_used: true`.
- `setup-council.sh` wizard now prompts for Codex CLI vs API and
  optional OpenRouter key.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 6 (content-hash cache)

- `~/.claude/council/cache/<key>.json` cache keyed by
  sha256(plan | git_head | cwd). Hits within TTL replay output with a
  `[cached <ts>]` marker and zero provider calls.
- TTL configurable via `config.cache.ttl_days` (default 7).
- `--no-cache` flag bypasses for one run.
- New `/council clear-cache` slash command + `brain clear-cache`
  subcommand.
- Cache hits log a `cache_hit: true` row to `usage.jsonl` so
  `/council-stats` reflects savings.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 7 (GSD integration)

- `templates/base/skills/council-integration/SKILL.md` documents
  the integration patterns for `/gsd-plan-phase --council`,
  `/gsd-execute-phase --council`, and the audit Council pass.
  Verdict-handling rules (PROCEED / SIMPLIFY / RETHINK / SKIP) +
  troubleshooting matrix.
- Skill triggers in `skill-rules.json` + manifest registration.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 8 (QoL features)

- `detect_domain()` classifies the plan into security / performance /
  ux / migration / general from regex on plan keywords.
- 8 persona overlay prompts under
  `templates/council-prompts/personas/`. Non-general domains layer the
  matching `<domain>-skeptic.md` / `<domain>-pragmatist.md` overlay on
  top of the base prompt at every reviewer call site.
- `--dry-run` flag builds the full Skeptic + Pragmatist prompts (with
  context, persona, redaction) and prints them with an estimated cost.
  Exits 0 without API calls.
- `--format json` emits a single-line JSON object
  `{verdict, skeptic, pragmatist, concerns_skeptic[], concerns_pragmatist[],
  domain, plan_hash, git_head, fallback_used: {skeptic, pragmatist},
  cache_hit, ...}` for tooling integration. Cache hits also emit JSON
  with `cache_hit: true`.
- TL;DR auto-summary block at the top of every written
  `council-report.md` carries verdict + top 3 concerns + detected
  domain.
- New `--mode retro --commit <sha>` retrospective review reads the
  commit diff plus the prior Council report and renders ALIGNED /
  DRIFT / UNCLEAR.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 9 (multilingual prompts)

- Russian translations of the four system prompts under
  `templates/council-prompts/ru/`.
- `--lang en|ru|auto` flag (default `auto`). `auto` reads the first
  500 chars of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and switches to ru when the
  Cyrillic ratio exceeds 0.2.
- `load_prompt()` and `load_persona()` lookup order:
  `<lang>/<name>.md` → `<name>.md` → embedded fallback.
- Verdict tokens stay English so the orchestrator's parser remains
  language-agnostic.

#### Added — Sub-Phase 10 (docs + version bump)

- Rewrite of `commands/council.md` covering all new flags and modes.
- New `docs/COUNCIL.md` deep reference: architecture, provider matrix,
  cost considerations, customization (prompt editing, redaction
  patterns, persona prompts, ru locale), MCP integration pointer.
- README "Killer Features" row refreshed; pointer to
  `docs/COUNCIL.md`.
- Manifest version bumped from 4.6.0 to 4.7.0; plugin manifests
  follow.

#### Notes

Sub-Phase 11 (MCP server for Claude Desktop) is in progress on the
same milestone branch and will ship under a subsequent CHANGELOG
entry. Sub-Phase 1 already shipped under [4.5.0] - 2026-04-29.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Unified TUI installer** (`scripts/install.sh`) — TUI-01..07, DET-01..05,
  DISPATCH-01..03, BACKCOMPAT-01: Phase 24. Single curl-bash entry point
  rendering an arrow-navigable Bash 3.2 checklist (no Bash 4-only constructs)
  with auto-detect of toolkit / superpowers / GSD / security pack / RTK /
  statusline. `--yes` for CI, `--force` re-runs detected, `--no-color`
  honored, `Ctrl-C` restores terminal cleanly. Foundation libs
  (`scripts/lib/{tui,detect2,dispatch}.sh`) reused by Phases 25-26. Hermetic
  test: `scripts/tests/test-install-tui.sh` (38+ assertions, Test 31).

- **MCP catalog + per-MCP wizard** (`scripts/lib/mcp.sh`,
  `scripts/lib/mcp-catalog.json`) — MCP-01..05,
  MCP-SEC-01..02: Phase 25. Nine curated MCP servers (`context7`, `firecrawl`,
  `magic`, `notion`, `openrouter`, `playwright`, `resend`, `sentry`,
  `sequential-thinking`) browsable via `scripts/install.sh --mcps`. Per-MCP
  wizard collects API keys with hidden input (`read -rs`), persists to
  `~/.claude/mcp-config.env` (mode 0600), invokes `claude mcp add`. Fail-soft
  when CLI absent. Hermetic test: `scripts/tests/test-mcp-selector.sh`
  (Test 32).

- **Skills marketplace mirror** (`templates/skills-marketplace/`,
  `scripts/lib/skills.sh`, `scripts/sync-skills-mirror.sh`) — SKILL-01..05:
  Phase 26. 22 curated skills mirrored from upstream skills.sh (license-audited,
  documented in `docs/SKILLS-MIRROR.md`). `scripts/install.sh --skills`
  copies selected skills to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` via `cp -R`.
  `manifest.json` registers all 22 under `files.skills_marketplace[]` so
  `update-claude.sh` ships skill updates. Hermetic test:
  `scripts/tests/test-install-skills.sh` (15 assertions, Test 33).

- **Plugin marketplace surface** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`,
  `plugins/tk-{skills,commands,framework-rules}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  symlink trees) — MKT-01, MKT-02: Phase 27. Three sub-plugins discoverable
  via `claude plugin marketplace add sergei-aronsen/claude-code-toolkit`.
  `tk-skills` is Desktop-Code-tab compatible; `tk-commands` and
  `tk-framework-rules` are Code-only. Sub-plugin content trees are relative
  symlinks into the canonical repo content (zero duplication, zero drift).
  Version is the single source of truth in each `plugin.json` (4.6.0);
  `marketplace.json` plugin entries do not declare versions per spec.

- **Marketplace + Desktop-skills validators** (`scripts/validate-marketplace.sh`,
  `scripts/validate-skills-desktop.sh`) — MKT-03, DESK-02, DESK-04: Phase 27.
  `validate-marketplace` runs `claude plugin marketplace add ./` smoke when
  `TK_HAS_CLAUDE_CLI=1` (CI default skips with no-op notice).
  `validate-skills-desktop` scans every `templates/skills-marketplace/*/SKILL.md`
  for tool-execution patterns; PASS = Desktop-safe instruction-only,
  FLAG = Code-terminal-only. Threshold: >= 4 PASS or `make check` fails. Both
  targets wired into `make check`; `validate-skills-desktop` runs as a
  dedicated CI step.

- **Desktop-only auto-routing** (`scripts/install.sh --skills-only`) — DESK-03:
  Phase 27. Users without `claude` on PATH running the installer (no flags) are
  auto-routed to `--skills-only` mode; skills land at
  `~/.claude/plugins/tk-skills/<name>/` (Desktop install location) instead of
  `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. One-line banner explains the routing. Explicit
  `--skills-only` flag also available for users with the CLI who only want
  skills. Hermetic test: `scripts/tests/test-install-tui.sh` S10 scenario.

- **Claude Desktop capability matrix** (`docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md`) — DESK-01:
  Phase 27. Four-column matrix (Capability x Desktop Code Tab x Desktop Chat
  Tab x Code Terminal) covering skills, slash commands, MCPs, statusline,
  security pack, and framework rules. Plain-English explanation of why Chat
  tab and remote Code sessions block plugins. Read-time target: under one
  minute.

- **Marketplace install documentation** (`README.md`, `docs/INSTALL.md`) —
  MKT-04: Phase 27. README and INSTALL.md gain "Install via marketplace"
  sections alongside the existing curl-bash install. Both channels documented
  as equivalent for terminal Code users; marketplace is the only path for
  Desktop users.

### Changed

- **Manifest version** bumped from 4.4.0 to 4.6.0 (final v4.5 milestone bump).
  `init-local.sh --version` derives from manifest at runtime, so no script
  changes needed.

- **`make check` chain** extended with `validate-skills-desktop` (always
  runs) and `validate-marketplace` (runs `claude plugin marketplace add ./`
  when `TK_HAS_CLAUDE_CLI=1`, no-op skip otherwise).

- **CI workflow** (`quality.yml`) gains a dedicated
  `DESK-02/DESK-04 — Skills Desktop-safety audit` step.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-04-29

### Phase 24 Sub-Phase 1 — Globalize Council artifacts

#### Added

- **Global `/council` slash command** — `setup-council.sh` and
  `init-claude.sh::setup_council` now download `commands/council.md`
  upstream into `~/.claude/commands/` (alongside the existing
  `~/.claude/council/brain.py`, `~/.claude/council/config.json`, and
  `~/.claude/council/prompts/audit-review.md` artifacts). Idempotent +
  mtime-aware download mirrors the `prompts/audit-review.md` pattern.
  Result: one global Council install drives every project, no per-project
  duplication.

- **`scripts/lib/cli-recommendations.sh`** — shared helper that detects
  whether `gemini` (Gemini CLI) and `codex` (Codex CLI) are on `$PATH`
  and prints install hints for whichever is missing. Sourced by both
  `setup-council.sh` and `init-claude.sh::setup_council`. Output is
  appended to `~/.claude/council/setup.log` for later auditing.
  Detection is informational only — never blocks setup.

- **Supreme Council section in `templates/global/CLAUDE.md`** —
  new section 15, with `## 16. USER PREFERENCES` renumbered from 15.
  Carries the v4.4 per-project Council description verbatim;
  Sub-Phase 2 will rewrite the body around the FP-recheck mandate.

- **Stale per-project `council.md` cleanup** in
  `scripts/migrate-to-complement.sh` — runs at the dry-run preview, the
  "no SP/GSD duplicates found" early exit, and the production tail.
  Detects `./.claude/commands/council.md` left over from v4.4 installs,
  warns when a global counterpart with different sha256 exists (possible
  user customization), and prompts for interactive removal. `--yes`
  accepts automatically; idempotent on re-run.

- **`verify-install.sh` Council checks** — Section 5 now verifies
  `~/.claude/commands/council.md` exists, `brain.py` is `+x`,
  `config.json` permissions are `0600` (BSD `stat -f %Lp` with GNU
  `stat -c %a` fallback), and `alias brain=` is declared in
  `.zshrc` / `.bash_profile` / `.bashrc`.

#### Changed

- **Per-project `commands/council.md` no longer ships** — removed from
  `manifest.json::files.commands[]`. Smart-update / fresh installs no
  longer copy it into `./.claude/commands/`. Existing v4.4 installs keep
  their local copy until `migrate-to-complement.sh` is run.
- **`templates/{base,go,laravel,nextjs,nodejs,python,rails}/CLAUDE.md`** —
  `## Supreme Council (Optional)` body shrinks to a one-line pointer
  (`> Supreme Council is global — see ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ...`). Heading
  drops the `(Optional)` suffix to match
  `manifest.json::claude_md_sections.system`.
- **`scripts/validate-manifest.py`** — new `GLOBAL_ONLY_COMMANDS` set
  exempts `council.md` from the disk-to-manifest drift check so the file
  can stay in `commands/` for upstream curl fetches without re-triggering
  drift.
- **`README.md`** — Killer Features row notes `/council` is now installed
  globally to `~/.claude/commands/`.

#### Notes

This release closes Phase 24 Sub-Phase 1 (Globalize Council artifacts).
Sub-Phases 2–11 (file-based prompts, FP-recheck, context enrichment,
cost tracking, OpenRouter / Codex CLI fallback, caching, GSD
integration, QoL flags, multilingual prompts, MCP server) follow under
the same v4.5.0 heading as they ship.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **SP/GSD bootstrap installer** (`scripts/lib/bootstrap.sh`, `scripts/lib/optional-plugins.sh`) —
  BOOTSTRAP-01..04: `init-claude.sh` and `init-local.sh` now offer to install `superpowers`
  via `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official` and `get-shit-done` via the
  canonical curl install before detection runs. Prompts default to `N`, fail closed when no
  TTY is available, and `--no-bootstrap` (or `TK_NO_BOOTSTRAP=1`) suppresses them entirely
  for CI. After bootstrap, `detect.sh` re-runs so the toolkit installs in the correct mode
  (`complement-sp` / `complement-gsd` / `complement-full`). Hermetic test:
  `scripts/tests/test-bootstrap.sh` (Test 28).

- **Smart-update coverage for `scripts/lib/*.sh`** — LIB-01: all six sourced helper libraries
  (`backup.sh`, `bootstrap.sh`, `dry-run-output.sh`, `install.sh`, `optional-plugins.sh`,
  `state.sh`) registered in `manifest.json` under a new `files.libs[]` array. LIB-02:
  `update-claude.sh` now refreshes stale lib files using the same diff/backup/safe-write
  contract as top-level scripts — zero code changes to the update loop required (the existing
  `jq -c '[.files | to_entries[] | .value[] | .path]'` query auto-discovers the new key).
  Hermetic test: `scripts/tests/test-update-libs.sh` (Test 29) — five scenarios proving
  stale-refresh, clean-untouched, fresh-install, modified-file fail-closed, and uninstall
  round-trip across all six libs.

- **`--no-banner` flag for `init-claude.sh` and `init-local.sh`** — BANNER-01: both
  installers now accept `--no-banner` (and the `NO_BANNER=1` env var) to suppress the
  closing `To remove: bash <(curl …)` line. Default behaviour (flag absent) is byte-identical
  to v4.3. Symmetric with `update-claude.sh`, which already honoured this flag. Hermetic test:
  `scripts/tests/test-install-banner.sh` extended from 3 to 7 source-grep assertions
  covering the new defaults, argparse clauses, and gates in both init scripts.

- **`--keep-state` flag for `scripts/uninstall.sh`** — KEEP-01: passing `--keep-state`
  (or setting `TK_UNINSTALL_KEEP_STATE=1`) preserves `~/.claude/toolkit-install.json`
  after the run instead of deleting it as the LAST step. All other UN-01..UN-08 invariants
  (backup, sentinel-strip, base-plugin diff-q) are unchanged. A subsequent `uninstall.sh`
  invocation sees the state file, re-classifies still-present modified files, and re-presents
  the `[y/N/d]` prompt — enabling recovery after a partial-N uninstall session.

- **Hermetic test for `--keep-state`** — KEEP-02: `scripts/tests/test-uninstall-keep-state.sh`
  (Test 30) proves three scenarios end-to-end: N-choice preserves state and second run
  re-classifies modified files (S1: A1+A2+A3+A4); y-choice preserves state on full-y branch
  (S2: A1); `TK_UNINSTALL_KEEP_STATE=1` env-only path preserves state with no `--keep-state`
  flag (S3: A1, D-09 env-precedence).

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Uninstall script** (`scripts/uninstall.sh`) — single command to safely remove every
  toolkit-installed file from a project's `.claude/` while preserving user modifications
  and base plugins (`superpowers`, `get-shit-done`).
  - UN-01: removes registered files only when current SHA256 matches the recorded hash;
    files outside the project's `.claude/` and inside base-plugin trees are never touched
  - UN-02: `--dry-run` prints a 4-group preview (REMOVE / KEEP / MODIFIED / MISSING) and
    exits 0 with zero filesystem changes
  - UN-03: modified files trigger a `[y/N/d]` prompt read from `< /dev/tty`; default `N`
    keeps the file, `d` shows a diff against the manifest reference and re-prompts
  - UN-04: full `.claude/` backup written to `~/.claude-backup-pre-uninstall-<unix-ts>/`
    before any delete; `--no-backup` flag does not exist

- **State cleanup + idempotency**
  - UN-05: deletes `~/.claude/toolkit-install.json` after successful removal and strips
    any `<!-- TOOLKIT-START -->`…`<!-- TOOLKIT-END -->` block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`;
    user-authored sections preserved verbatim
  - UN-06: second invocation detects missing state file, prints
    `✓ Toolkit not installed; nothing to do`, exits 0, creates no backup directory

- **Distribution** — `manifest.json` registers `scripts/uninstall.sh` under
  `files.scripts[]`; `init-claude.sh`, `init-local.sh`, and `update-claude.sh` end-of-run
  banners include the line
  `To remove: bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergei-aronsen/claude-code-toolkit/main/scripts/uninstall.sh)`
  (UN-07).

- **Round-trip integration test** — `scripts/tests/test-uninstall.sh` (Makefile Test 24)
  exercises the full install→uninstall round-trip across 5 scenario blocks; new
  `scripts/tests/test-install-banner.sh` (Test 25) gates banner presence in all 3
  installers (UN-08).

## [4.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Persistent FP allowlist** — `.claude/rules/audit-exceptions.md` auto-seeds via `globs: ["**/*"]`
  and is consulted by `/audit` Phase 0 to drop known false positives before reporting (EXC-01..05).
- **`/audit-skip <file:line> <rule> <reason>`** — appends a structured exception block to
  `audit-exceptions.md` after validating the file:line exists in the working tree and that the
  entry is not already allowlisted.
- **`/audit-restore <file:line> <rule>`** — comment-aware removal of an allowlist entry with a
  `[y/N]` confirmation prompt.
- **6-phase `/audit` workflow** — load context → quick check → deep analysis → 6-step FP recheck
  → structured report → mandatory Council pass. Every reported finding survives the FP-recheck and
  ships with verbatim ±10 lines of source code so the Council reasons from the code, not the rule
  label.
- **Structured audit reports** — `/audit` writes to `.claude/audits/<type>-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`
  with a fixed schema: Summary table → Findings (ID, severity, rule, location, claim, verbatim
  code, data flow, "why it's real", suggested fix) → Skipped (allowlist) → Skipped (FP recheck)
  → Council verdict slot.
- **Mandatory Supreme Council `audit-review` mode** — every `/audit` run terminates in
  `/council audit-review --report <path>`. Council emits per-finding
  `REAL | FALSE_POSITIVE | NEEDS_MORE_CONTEXT` verdicts with confidence scores in `[0.0, 1.0]`,
  plus a "Missed findings" section. Severity reclassification is explicitly forbidden (COUNCIL-02).
- **`brain.py --mode audit-review`** — runs Gemini and ChatGPT in parallel for audit-review, flags
  per-finding disagreements as `disputed` without auto-resolution.
- **Template propagation across all 49 prompt files** — every
  `templates/{base,laravel,rails,nextjs,nodejs,python,go}/prompts/{SECURITY_AUDIT,CODE_REVIEW,PERFORMANCE_AUDIT,MYSQL_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT,POSTGRES_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT,DEPLOY_CHECKLIST,DESIGN_REVIEW}.md`
  carries the audit-exceptions callout, 6-step FP-recheck SELF-CHECK, structured OUTPUT FORMAT,
  and Council Handoff footer.

### Changed

- **`manifest.json`** — bumped to `4.2.0` and registered `templates/base/rules/audit-exceptions.md`
  under `files.rules`.
- **`commands/audit.md`** — rewritten around the 6-phase workflow; documents the Council Handoff UX
  (FALSE_POSITIVE nudge → user runs `/audit-skip`; disputed verdict prompt).
- **`commands/council.md`** — added `## Modes` section with `audit-review` subsection documenting
  input format (path to structured audit report), expected Council prompt, and verdict-table output
  schema.

### Fixed

- *None — this is an additive feature release. See [4.1.1] for the prior patch.*

### Documentation

- **CI gates** — `make validate` now asserts every audit prompt carries the `Council Handoff`
  marker plus all six numbered FP-recheck steps; missing markers fail the build (TEMPLATE-03).
- **`make test`** — adds Test 18 (audit pipeline fixture), Test 19 (Council audit-review
  verdict-slot rewrite + parallel dispatch), Test 20 (template propagation idempotency).

## [4.1.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **CRIT-01** — Replaced fragile 95-line emoji-anchored sed smart-merge in `update-claude.sh` with chezmoi-style `.new` flow. Toolkit never touches user `CLAUDE.md`; updates land as `CLAUDE.md.new` for manual review/merge.
- **CRIT-02** — Aligned `manifest.json` version with v4.1.0 git tag.
- **C-01..C-10** — Lock TOCTOU fix in `state.sh`, atomic state-write with manifest_hash, `curl -sSLf` (fail on HTTP 4xx/5xx) across all installers, anchored regex in `setup-security.sh`, JSON-based plugin presence check.
- **Sec-H1** — Anthropic OAuth Bearer token moved off `curl` argv. Written to `mktemp` header file with `chmod 600`, passed via `-H @file`. EXIT trap cleans up.
- **BRAIN-H1..H4, M1, M2, M5** — `brain.py` corrected docstring, `Path.relative_to` validation, stdin body, header-file auth (chmod 0o600), partial-Council fallback (one provider failure → use surviving verdict), per-provider availability flags.
- **S-01** — All hook scripts in `templates/*/settings.json` read `f=$(jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')` from STDIN. Removed undefined `$FILE_PATH` references.
- **PERF-02** — `sha256_file` prefers `sha256sum` → `shasum -a 256` → chunked Python fallback.
- **T-02, T-05** — New regression suite `test-claude-md-new.sh` (19 assertions, 7 scenarios). CI matrix extended to `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]` for `test-init-script` job.
- **M-03** — `make shellcheck` extended to `templates/global/`.

### Notes

Patch release closing 53 audit findings (2 CRIT, 14 HIGH, 20 MED, 17 LOW) cross-reviewed by Supreme Council. Council follow-up applied 4 additional refinements (passes A/B/C/D).

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Phase 11 UX polish: chezmoi-grade dry-run preview with `[+ ADD]` / `[~ MOD]` / `[- REMOVE]` grouping for both `install` and `update` flows.
- `migrate-to-complement.sh --dry-run` now emits the same grouped preview before any destructive change.
- New audit pipeline (`AUDIT-REPORT.md`) — full deep audit covering security, correctness, performance, portability, JSON state-file integrity. Cross-AI reviewed via Supreme Council (Gemini Skeptic + ChatGPT Pragmatist).

### Fixed

- `manifest.json` `version` and `updated` fields now match the `v4.1.0` git tag (previously drifted at `4.0.0` / `2026-04-19`).

### Notes

This release closes the v4.1 milestone. See `.planning/archived/v4.1/` for phase artifacts.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-21

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Default install behavior changes when SP and/or GSD are detected.** Previously (v3.x) all
  54 TK files installed unconditionally. v4.0 auto-selects `complement-*` mode and skips 7 files
  (6 commands/skills + 1 agent) that duplicate SP functionality. Users who relied on TK's
  `/debug`, `/plan`, `/tdd`, `/verify`, `/worktree`, `skills/debugging`, or TK-owned
  `agents/code-reviewer.md` will instead use SP's equivalents. Override: `--mode standalone`.
- **7 files are no longer installed in `complement-sp` mode:** `agents/code-reviewer.md`,
  `commands/debug.md`, `commands/plan.md`, `commands/tdd.md`, `commands/verify.md`,
  `commands/worktree.md`, `skills/debugging/SKILL.md`. Users relying on TK's copies must use
  SP's equivalents.
- **`manifest.json` schema bumped from v1 (implicit) to v2 (explicit `manifest_version: 2`).**
  Old v3.x install scripts refuse to run against a v2 manifest. Users running an old installer
  against the v4.0 repo see a hard error: `manifest.json has manifest_version=2; this installer
  expects v1`.
- **`toolkit-install.json` state schema bumped v1 → v2.** v1 installs read correctly via
  `jq '... // false'` backwards-compat default on the new `synthesized_from_filesystem` field,
  but v1 tooling reading the new field directly will see `null`.
- **`scripts/init-local.sh` no longer hardcodes version.** Reads from `manifest.json` at runtime
  via `jq`. The `VERSION="2.0.0"` constant is removed from line 11.
- **`scripts/update-claude.sh` no longer hand-iterates a file list.** The iterated list now comes
  from `manifest.json`. Custom TK installs that relied on update-claude.sh skipping certain files
  will see those files installed on next update (if listed in manifest).
- **`~/.claude/settings.json` is now merged additively.** `setup-security.sh` no longer overwrites
  the file — it reads, merges only TK-owned keys (permissions.deny, hooks.PreToolUse, env block),
  and writes via atomic temp-file rename.
- **Post-update summary format changed** from unstructured log lines to a 4-group block
  (`INSTALLED N`, `UPDATED M`, `SKIPPED P (with reason)`, `REMOVED Q (backed up to path)`).
  Users who scrape update output must adjust. Backup directories are now suffixed with PID
  (`~/.claude-backup-<unix-ts>-<pid>/`) to prevent same-second collision.

### Added

- `scripts/detect.sh` — filesystem detection of `superpowers` and `get-shit-done`; sources
  `HAS_SP`, `HAS_GSD`, `SP_VERSION`, `GSD_VERSION` environment variables.
- `scripts/lib/install.sh` — `recommend_mode`, `compute_skip_set`, `MODES` array for
  mode-aware installs.
- `scripts/lib/state.sh` — atomic `write_state`, `acquire_lock`, `release_lock`, `sha256_file`
  for install-state management.
- `scripts/migrate-to-complement.sh` — one-time migration for v3.x users with SP/GSD installed;
  three-column hash diff, `[y/N/d]` per-file prompt, `cp -R` full backup, idempotent.
- `~/.claude/toolkit-install.json` — install state file: mode, detected bases, installed files
  with sha256 hashes, skipped files with reasons. Schema v2 adds `synthesized_from_filesystem`.
- 4 install modes: `standalone`, `complement-sp`, `complement-gsd`, `complement-full`.
- `--mode <name>` flag on `init-claude.sh` and `init-local.sh` — overrides auto-detected mode
  with interactive prompt and auto-recommendation.
- `--dry-run` flag on `init-claude.sh` — previews `[INSTALL]`/`[SKIP]` per file without writing.
- `--offer-mode-switch=yes|no|interactive`, `--prune=yes|no|interactive`, `--no-banner` flags
  on `update-claude.sh`.
- `conflicts_with`, `sp_equivalent`, `requires_base` fields on per-file manifest entries.
- `make validate-manifest.py` check — every manifest path exists, `conflicts_with` values are
  from the known plugin set.
- Makefile test targets: 14 test groups (up from 0), all hermetic — covering detect, install,
  state, update drift, update diff, update summary, migrate diff, migrate flow, migrate idempotence.
- `components/orchestration-pattern.md` — lean orchestrator + fat subagents pattern.
- `components/optional-plugins.md` — rtk, caveman, superpowers, get-shit-done recommendations
  with verified caveats.
- `templates/global/RTK.md` — fallback RTK notes with rtk-ai/rtk#1276 caveat and workaround.
- `## Required Base Plugins` section in all 7 `templates/*/CLAUDE.md` files — discloses SP/GSD
  dependency and install commands so new users set up the full complement stack first.
- `manifest.json` `inventory.components` bucket (non-install metadata for Phase 6 components).
- `Makefile validate-base-plugins` drift guard — verifies all 7 templates carry the section
  heading on every `make check`.

### Changed

- `scripts/init-claude.sh` — refactored to 4-mode dispatch; sources `detect.sh` +
  `lib/install.sh` from `$REPO_URL` on remote installs; respects `--mode` override;
  manifest-schema-v2 guard hard-fails on v1 manifests.
- `scripts/init-local.sh` — same mode-aware logic as `init-claude.sh`; reads version from
  `manifest.json` at runtime (removes `VERSION="2.0.0"` hardcode).
- `scripts/update-claude.sh` — rewritten for re-detection on every run, mode-drift surfacing,
  manifest-driven iteration, 4-group summary, D-77 migrate hint when complement migration
  is appropriate.
- `scripts/setup-security.sh` — safe `~/.claude/settings.json` merge with timestamped backup
  (`settings.json.bak.<unix-ts>`); restore-on-merge-failure.
- `scripts/setup-council.sh` — `< /dev/tty` guards on every interactive `read`; silent
  `read -rs` for API-key prompts; `python3 json.dumps()` for API-key heredoc interpolation.
- `README.md` — repositioned as "complement to superpowers + get-shit-done"; install section
  shows standalone + complement modes with one paragraph of guidance per mode.
- `manifest.json` — schema v2 (`manifest_version: 2`); 7 entries gain `conflicts_with`; 6
  entries gain `sp_equivalent`.

### Fixed

- BUG-01: BSD-incompatible `head -n -1` in `scripts/update-claude.sh` smart-merge replaced
  with POSIX `sed '$d'`. Silent CLAUDE.md truncation on macOS fixed.
- BUG-02: `< /dev/tty` guards on every interactive `read` in `scripts/setup-council.sh`;
  silent `read -rs` for API-key prompts. Fixes curl|bash prompts being consumed as stream.
- BUG-03: `python3 json.dumps` JSON-escapes API keys containing `"`, `\`, newline in
  heredoc-written `config.json`. Fixes malformed Council config.
- BUG-04: Silent `sudo apt-get install tree` in `setup-council.sh` replaced with interactive
  prompt and visible error path.
- BUG-05: `setup-security.sh` timestamped backup of `~/.claude/settings.json` before every
  mutation; restore-on-merge-failure.
- BUG-06: `scripts/init-local.sh` reads version from `manifest.json`; `make validate`
  enforces manifest ↔ CHANGELOG version alignment.
- BUG-07: `commands/design.md` added to `update-claude.sh` loop (structurally fixed in
  Phase 4: update loop now iterates manifest, not a hand-list).

### Migration from v3.x

See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the install matrix and `scripts/migrate-to-complement.sh`
for the automated migration path (per-file confirmation, full backup before any removal).
