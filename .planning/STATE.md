# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Install only what adds value over `superpowers` + `get-shit-done`. No duplicates, no name collisions.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — install-flow

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (install-flow) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 03
Last activity: 2026-04-18 -- Phase 03 execution started

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 14%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Phase 1 must complete before any complement-mode logic — BUG-01 (BSD head) would corrupt merge logic built on top of it
- Init: STATE-04 (SHA256 hashes) is a hard dependency for MIGRATE phase — migration cannot safely detect user-modified files without it
- Init: SAFETY (settings.json merge) folded into Phase 3 alongside MODE — independent but shares install flow delivery boundary

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BUG-01 (BSD head -n -1) is load-bearing: until fixed, any macOS update run risks silent CLAUDE.md data loss. Phase 1 unblocks all phases.
- No research/SUMMARY.md was present; research context loaded from FEATURES.md, PITFALLS.md, CONCERNS.md directly.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| v2 | BACKUP-01: --clean-backups flag | Deferred to v4.1 | Roadmap init |
| v2 | BACKUP-02: warn on backup count threshold | Deferred to v4.1 | Roadmap init |
| v2 | DETECT-FUT-01: claude plugin list integration | Deferred to v4.1 | Roadmap init |
| v2 | DETECT-FUT-02: plugin version skew detection | Deferred to v4.1 | Roadmap init |
| v2 | TEST-01: bats automation for install matrix | Deferred to v4.1 | Roadmap init |
