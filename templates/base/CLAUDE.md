# [Project Name] — Claude Code Instructions

> **This is a PROJECT-LEVEL template.** Install into `project/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, not `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
> For global setup, use `setup-security.sh` instead. See `components/claude-md-guide.md` for details.

## Project Overview

**Stack:** [Framework] + [Frontend] + [Database]
**Type:** [SaaS/API/Dashboard/etc.]
**Description:** [Brief description]

## Required Base Plugins

This toolkit is designed to **complement** two Claude Code plugins. Install them first for
the full experience; TK will auto-detect them and skip duplicate files.

| Plugin | Purpose | Install |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `superpowers` (obra) | Skills (debugging, plans, TDD, verification, worktrees), `code-reviewer` agent | `claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official` |
| `get-shit-done` (gsd-build) | Phase-based workflow: `/gsd-plan-phase`, `/gsd-execute-phase`, and more | `bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/main/scripts/install.sh)` |

> **Without these plugins** TK still installs in `standalone` mode — you get every TK file,
> but you'll miss SP's systematic debugging and GSD's phase workflow. See
> [optional-plugins.md](https://github.com/sergei-aronsen/claude-code-toolkit/blob/main/components/optional-plugins.md)
> for the full rationale (components are repo-root assets — they are NOT installed into
> `.claude/`, so use the absolute GitHub blob URL).

## 📌 Compact Instructions

> **Keep these critical rules when compacting:**

1. **Security:** DO NOT concatenate user input in SQL/HTML, ALWAYS validate input
2. **Architecture:** KISS, YAGNI, DO NOT create files without confirmation
3. **Workflow:** Plan Mode before code, 3 phases (Research → Plan → Execute)
4. **Git:** Conventional Commits, DO NOT push to main directly, RUN LINTERS before commit
5. **Language:** ALL code comments, commits, docs, AND public GitHub content (PR titles/bodies, issue comments, code reviews, release notes) in English only — no exceptions, even if chat is non-English
6. **Directory:** STAY in current working directory, DO NOT cd to parent/sibling folders
7. **User-Agent:** NEVER use default library UA, ALWAYS set real browser User-Agent

---

## AT THE START OF EACH SESSION

1. **Verify directory:** `pwd` + `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — lock this directory for the session
2. **Context is auto-loaded** from `.claude/rules/` — no manual reads needed
3. **For on-demand details:** read `.claude/docs/` files as needed

---

## WORKFLOW RULES (MANDATORY!)

### Plan Mode — ALWAYS USE BEFORE CODE

1. **Activate Plan Mode** — `Shift+Tab` twice
2. **Research** the task and existing code
3. **Create a plan** in `.claude/scratchpad/current-task.md`
4. **Wait for confirmation** before writing code

**Thinking levels:**

| Word | When to use |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| `think` | Simple tasks |
| `think hard` | Medium complexity |
| `think harder` | Architectural decisions |
| `ultrathink` | Critical decisions, security |

**Prompt example:**

```text
"Analyze task [description]. Think harder about edge cases.
DO NOT WRITE CODE — plan only."
```

### Structured Workflow (for complex tasks)

For features, refactoring, multi-file changes — use 3 phases:

| Phase | Access | What to do |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| **RESEARCH** | Read-only | Glob, Grep, Read — understand context |
| **PLAN** | Scratchpad-only | Write plan in `.claude/scratchpad/` |
| **EXECUTE** | Full access | After confirmation — implement |

**Rule:** Do not proceed to the next phase until you complete the current one.

### Git Workflow

- **Branch naming:** `feature/xxx`, `fix/xxx`, `refactor/xxx`
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- **NEVER** push directly to `main`
- **CHANGELOG** — update on `feat:`, `fix:`, breaking changes
- **PARALLEL SESSIONS** — user may run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously. If you see commits you didn't make, that's normal — another session made them. Always `git pull` before commit/push. **Before build/deploy: `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main`** to include changes from other sessions.
- **BEFORE COMMIT** — run linters, pull latest:

```bash
# Run project linters (adjust command for your project)
npm run lint   # or: make check / pnpm lint / etc.

# Pull latest changes (parallel sessions may have pushed)
git pull --rebase
```

### Git Worktree Workflow (Parallel Sessions)

> **If multiple Claude sessions work on same repo, use git worktrees to avoid conflicts.**

**At session start — detect worktree:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

- If branch is `work-1`, `work-2`, `work-3`, `work-4` → you're in a worktree
- If branch is `main` → you're in main repo

**⚠️ NEVER run destructive git commands without asking!**

Before `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -f`, `git rebase`, `git stash`:

1. Run `git status` — check for uncommitted changes
2. If changes exist — **STOP and ASK USER**
3. Show what will be lost with `git diff`

**⚠️ NEVER do `git stash && git rebase && git stash pop` automatically!**

- Stash pop conflicts = changes stuck in stash
- Always commit first, then rebase (or use merge)

**⚠️ NEVER resolve merge conflicts automatically!**

- If you see `CONFLICT` — STOP and ask user
- Don't use `--theirs` or `--ours` without permission

**⚠️ Before EVERY push to main** — fetch and merge to avoid overwriting other sessions:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# If CONFLICT — STOP and ask user!
git push origin main
```

**Working in worktree (work-1, work-2, etc.):**

1. **Before starting** — check status then sync with main:

   ```bash
   git status  # CRITICAL: check for uncommitted changes first!
   # If changes exist — ask user before proceeding!
   git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

2. **Work normally** — make changes, test

3. **When complete** — merge to main:

   ```bash
   git add <files> && git commit -m "feat: ..."
   git checkout main && git merge work-X --no-edit && git push origin main
   git checkout work-X
   git status  # Check before reset!
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

## Security Rules (NEVER VIOLATE!)

1. **Input Validation** — ALWAYS validate user input
2. **SQL Injection** — NEVER concatenate user input into queries
3. **XSS** — NEVER output user data without escaping
4. **Authorization** — ALWAYS check permissions before operations
5. **Secrets** — NEVER hardcode keys and passwords
6. **User-Agent** — NEVER use default/library User-Agent for HTTP requests. ALWAYS set a real browser UA:
   `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`

## 🛡️ Production Safety

### Bug Fix Approach

- Try **simplest solution first** — remove unnecessary code before adding new
- **ONE change at a time**, verify immediately
- If 2 attempts fail — **stop, re-analyze root cause** (`/debug`)
- After fix, verify no regressions

### Deployment

- Deploy **incrementally** — one logical change, verify between deploys
- Always fetch/merge latest before deploy
- **NEVER** batch-restart all workers — use rolling restarts
- Verify after every deploy: endpoints, logs, workers

### File Targeting

- Before editing, confirm **correct file variant** (V2, legacy, etc.)
- Confirm correct branch/worktree with `pwd` and `git branch`
- Check if already fixed upstream: `git log origin/main --oneline -5`

## Visual Self-Testing

After UI changes, test with Playwright MCP: navigate, check errors, interact, screenshot. Always call `browser_close` after. Guide: `components/playwright-self-testing.md`

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines (STRICT!)

1. **KISS Principle:** Simplest working solution. No premature optimization.
2. **YAGNI:** No features/abstractions "for the future". Solve only current problem.
3. **No Boilerplate:** No Interfaces/Factories/DTOs unless explicitly requested.
4. **File Structure:**
   - Keep logic co-located
   - Prefer larger files over many tiny files
   - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT create new files without asking confirmation first

## 💻 Coding Style

- Functional programming over complex OOP where possible
- If function fits in 50 lines — do NOT split into sub-functions
- One file doing one thing well > 5 files with abstractions

---

## 🎨 Code Style

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** `kebab-case.ts` or `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- **Variables:** `camelCase`
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Functions:** `camelCase`, verbs (`createUser`, `validateInput`)

### Best Practices

- Maximum 200 lines per file
- One responsibility per function/class
- Type annotations wherever possible
- Comments for complex logic
- **All code comments, commit messages, documentation, AND public GitHub content (PR titles/bodies, issue titles/comments, code review comments, release notes, repo wiki) in English** regardless of conversation language. The boundary is "publishes to GitHub" — chat replies, scratchpad notes, and `.planning/` artifacts can stay in the user's preferred language; once content lands on github.com, switch to English.

## Supreme Council

> Supreme Council is global — see `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` "Supreme Council" section.

---

## Scratchpad

Complex tasks: `.claude/scratchpad/current-task.md` for plans, `findings.md` for research, `decisions.md` for decisions.

---

## Knowledge Persistence

On significant changes, update: (1) `.claude/rules/` for project facts, (2) `.claude/CLAUDE.md` if workflow changed, (3) docs/README for humans. Use `/learn` to save debugging insights as scoped rule files in `.claude/rules/` with `globs:` — auto-loaded only for relevant files.

---

## Skill Accumulation (Self-Learning)

**You can learn from corrections and accumulate project knowledge.**

### When to CREATE a new skill

Suggest creating a skill when:

- User corrected you 2+ times on the same topic
- Discovered project-specific convention
- User said "remember this" or "always do it this way"

**Format:**

```text
Noticed a pattern: [description]
Save as skill '[name]'?
Will activate on: [triggers]
```

### When to UPDATE an existing skill

Suggest updating when you used a skill but user corrected:

```text
New information for skill '[name]':
Current: [what's in skill]
New: [what was learned]

Update?
[A] Add rule [B] Replace [C] Exception [D] No
```

### Lessons from Debugging

Use `/learn` to save debugging insights as scoped rule files in `.claude/rules/` (e.g., `rules/database.md` with `globs: ["models/**"]`). Rules auto-load only when working with matching files — no manual reads needed.

### When NOT to suggest

- One-time correction
- Obvious things
- User already declined

### Skills files

```text
.claude/skills/
├── skill-rules.json      # Activation rules
└── [skill-name]/
    └── SKILL.md          # Accumulated knowledge
```
