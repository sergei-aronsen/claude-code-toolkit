# Code Review — Base Template

<!-- v42-splice: callout -->
<!-- Audit exceptions allowlist: .claude/rules/audit-exceptions.md
     Consult this file before reporting any finding. Use /audit-skip to add
     an entry, /audit-restore to remove one. -->

## GOAL

Act as a regression-focused production reviewer. Identify realistic
correctness, reliability, and business-logic defects introduced or exposed
by the diff.

The objective is NOT to maximize the number of findings. The objective is to
identify the highest-impact real issues with the lowest possible
false-positive rate. A single precise, high-confidence finding is more
valuable than 20 speculative comments.

Avoid academic or purely stylistic feedback. Security auditing is handled by
`SECURITY_AUDIT.md`; do not perform speculative security analysis here
unless the diff directly introduces correctness-breaking authorization,
unsafe state transitions, or destructive data exposure within the modified
execution flow.

---

## PROJECT SPECIFICS — [Project Name]

Optional project-specific guidance. If this section is not filled in, ignore
it. Do not mention placeholder content in the final report.

**Accepted decisions (no need to fix):**

- [Intentional architectural decisions]

**Key files for review:**

- [Where business logic is]
- [Where controllers/routes are]
- [Where UI components are]

**Project patterns:**

- [Which patterns are used]

---

## QUICK CHECK (5 minutes)

Report only checks that were actually performed. Do not infer
test/build/lint status from code inspection alone.

| Check | Status |
| ------- | -------- |
| Syntax errors | Verified / Failed / Not verified / Not applicable |
| Linter | Verified / Failed / Not verified / Not applicable |
| Build | Verified / Failed / Not verified / Not applicable |
| Tests | Verified / Failed / Not verified / Not applicable |
| Debug code present | Verified / Failed / Not verified / Not applicable |

Status labels:

- **Verified** — command was actually executed and passed.
- **Failed** — command was executed and failed.
- **Not verified** — command was not run.
- **Not applicable** — check does not apply to this diff.

Never claim verification of build, tests, linting, type checking,
migrations, or runtime behavior unless the relevant command was actually
executed in the session.

---

## SEVERITY AND CONFIDENCE

Severity and confidence are orthogonal axes. Both are required on every
HIGH or CRITICAL finding.

**Severity** — use the canonical rubric in `components/severity-levels.md`
(CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW). INFO is NOT a reportable finding
severity; informational observations belong in the auditor's scratchpad,
never in `## Findings`. Do NOT redefine severity in the report. Re-rate
using the actual failure scenario, not the rule label. Do not inflate.

**Confidence** — auditor-judged certainty in the finding's reachability:

| Level | Description |
| ------- | ---------- |
| HIGH | Directly observable in code with a clear execution path. |
| MEDIUM | Strong evidence exists, some assumptions are inferred. |
| LOW | Weak signal or incomplete evidence. |

Avoid reporting LOW-confidence findings unless impact could be severe AND
the uncertainty is explicitly stated.

---

## DIFF AWARENESS

Assume unchanged code is stable unless the diff introduces or exposes a
failure path. Review depth decreases rapidly outside the changed execution
paths. Do not perform broad repository audits unrelated to the diff.

Treat newly introduced issues as higher priority than pre-existing code
quality problems. Do not aggressively report legacy issues unless:

- the current change worsens them
- the change directly touches the affected area
- the issue creates immediate risk

---

## SCOPE, PRIORITIES, AND APPROACH

Identify the actual execution paths affected by the diff. Focus depth on:

- modified logic
- affected call chains
- changed state transitions and async flows
- changed persistence or API boundaries

Prioritize findings in this order:

1. Correctness bugs
2. Invalid state transitions or data consistency risks
3. Concurrency / async issues
4. Architecture-related correctness or reliability risks
5. Performance issues with realistic production impact
6. Operational maintainability risks with measurable support or reliability cost

Before reporting any finding: understand the intent of the change, trace
affected execution paths, validate assumptions against actual code, and
estimate realistic production impact.

---

## EVIDENCE RULES

Do not assume hidden consumers, undocumented integrations, future scaling
requirements, external dependencies, or implicit contracts unless directly
evidenced in the reviewed code or diff.

Only report an issue if:

- the execution path is observable in code
- the execution flow is concrete
- the claim references actual tokens from source
- the issue is realistically reachable

Never speculate about missing code, assumed runtime behavior, hypothetical
future usage, or external integrations not present in the diff.

---

## BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION

Check the directly affected execution flow for:

- inverted conditions
- missing edge cases
- invalid state transitions
- race conditions
- partial updates
- transactional inconsistencies
- stale cache flows
- async ordering issues

Prioritize logic correctness over style.

---

## ARCHITECTURE AND CONSISTENCY

Reuse, design tokens, and named constants are correctness concerns when
the project already has the conventions established. Flag findings only
when concrete duplication or maintenance cost is evident in the diff —
not on speculation.

Check:

- **Component reuse.** A new component in the diff that re-implements a
  capability already covered by an existing component (visible via grep
  for the same primitive — button, modal, table row, form field). Treat
  as a finding only when the duplication is non-trivial (>30 LOC of
  parallel logic) and the existing component is reachable from the new
  call site without invasive refactor.
- **Design tokens.** Hardcoded color literals, pixel spacing, or font
  declarations when the project ships a token system (CSS variables,
  Tailwind theme, design-tokens package). Flag when the diff bypasses
  the system in a place where token usage is the established pattern.
- **Magic numbers.** Numeric literals in business logic, layout sizing,
  timeout values, retry counts, or threshold checks without a named
  constant. Flag when the value carries semantic meaning the reader
  must reverse-engineer from context.

Findings here must pass the LOW-VALUE REVIEW FILTER below: skip purely
stylistic preferences, premature abstractions, and refactors without
measurable maintenance benefit.

---

## LOW-VALUE REVIEW FILTER

Do not generate findings merely because a review category exists. Every
finding must justify realistic impact AND why resolving the issue is worth
the cost.

Do not request:

- additional tests without identifying a concrete uncovered risk
- documentation updates without missing operationally important behavior
- stronger typing unless type weakness creates realistic defects
- abstractions unless duplication or coupling creates measurable maintenance cost

Do not report:

- purely stylistic preferences
- naming alternatives without semantic benefit
- framework preference debates
- speculative micro-optimizations
- comments without measurable impact
- premature abstractions
- unnecessary architectural generalization
- refactors without measurable benefit

---

## UNCERTAINTY DISCIPLINE

If evidence is incomplete: lower confidence, reduce severity, move the
observation into Non-Blocking Observations, and explicitly state the
uncertainty. Do not present assumptions as facts. Do not use weasel
words ("could potentially", "might allow", "in theory") to inflate
report length — either the finding is grounded or it isn't.

---

<!-- v42-splice: rubric-anchors -->

**Audit rubric anchors** (canonical sources of truth — do not redefine inline):

- `components/audit-severity-anchor.md` — CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW labels + Severity Ceiling Table.
- `components/audit-uncertainty-discipline.md` — UNCERTAINTY DISCIPLINE (lower confidence / severity, anti-padding).
- `components/audit-fp-control-gates.md` — three-gate FALSE-POSITIVE CONTROL wrapper (Adversarial → 6-step recheck → Calibration). Gate 2 procedure is `## SELF-CHECK` below.

## SELF-CHECK (FP Recheck — 6-Step Procedure)
<!-- v42-splice: fp-recheck-section -->

### Procedure

For every candidate finding, execute these six steps in order. Produce a `## SELF-CHECK` block per finding (in your scratchpad — not the final report) before deciding whether to report or drop it. Each step has a fail-fast condition: if the finding fails any step, drop it and record the reason in `## Skipped (FP recheck)` (see schema below). Do not skip steps. Do not reorder.

1. **Read context** — Open the source file at `<path>:<line>` and load ±20 lines around the flagged line. Read the full surrounding function or block; do not reason from the rule label alone.
2. **Trace data flow** — Follow user input from its origin to the flagged sink. Name each hop (≤ 6 hops). If input never reaches the sink, the finding is a false positive — drop with `dropped_at_step: 2`.
3. **Check execution context** — Identify whether the code runs in test / production / background worker / service worker / build script / CI. Patterns that look exploitable in production may be required by the platform in another context (e.g. `eval` inside a build-time codegen script).
4. **Cross-reference exceptions** — Re-read `.claude/rules/audit-exceptions.md`. Look for entries on the same file or neighbouring lines that change the threat surface (e.g. an upstream sanitizer documented in another exception). Match key is byte-exact: same path, same line, same rule, same U+2014 em-dash separator.
5. **Apply platform-constraint rule** — If the pattern is required by the platform (MV3 service-worker MUST NOT use dynamic `importScripts`, OAuth `client_id` MUST be in `manifest.json`, CSP requires inline-style hashes, etc.), the finding is a design trade-off, not a vulnerability. Drop with the constraint named in the reason.
6. **Severity sanity check** — Re-rate severity using the actual exploit scenario, not the rule label. A theoretical XSS sink behind 3 unlikely preconditions and no PII is not CRITICAL. If you cannot describe a concrete attack path the user would care about, drop or downgrade.

If a finding survives all six steps, it proceeds to `## Findings` in the structured report.

---

### Skipped (FP recheck) Entry Format

Findings dropped at any step are listed in the report's `## Skipped (FP recheck)` table with these columns in order. The `one_line_reason` MUST be ≤ 100 characters and grounded in concrete tokens from the code — never `looks fine`, `trusted code`, or `out of scope`.

| path:line | rule | dropped_at_step | one_line_reason |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `src/auth.ts:42` | `SEC-XSS` | 2 | `value flows through escapeHtml() at line 38 before reaching innerHTML` |
| `lib/utils.py:5` | `SEC-EVAL` | 5 | `eval is required by build-time codegen; never reached at runtime` |

`dropped_at_step` MUST be an integer in the range 1-6 matching the step where the finding was dropped.

---

### When a Finding Survives All Six Steps

Promote it to `## Findings` using the entry schema documented in `components/audit-output-format.md` (ID, Severity, Rule, Location, Claim, Code, Data flow, Why it is real, Suggested fix). The `Why it is real` field MUST cite concrete tokens visible in the verbatim code block — that is the artifact the Council reasons from in Phase 15.

---

### Anti-Patterns

These behaviors break the recheck and MUST NOT appear in any audit report:

- Dropping a finding without recording the step number and reason — every drop is auditable.
- Reasoning from the rule label instead of the code — the recheck exists because rule names are pattern-matched, not exploit-verified.
- Reusing a generic `one_line_reason` across multiple findings — every reason MUST cite tokens from the specific code block.
- Skipping Step 4 because `audit-exceptions.md` is absent — when the file is missing, Step 4 is a no-op (record `cross-ref skipped: no allowlist file present`) but the step itself MUST be acknowledged in the SELF-CHECK trace.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (Structured Report Schema — Phase 14)
<!-- v42-splice: output-format-section -->

### Report Path

```text
.claude/audits/<type>-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md
```

- `<type>` is one of the 7 canonical slugs documented in the next section. Backward-compat aliases resolve to a canonical slug at dispatch time.
- Timestamp is local time, generated with `date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M'` (24-hour, no separator between hour and minute).
- The audit creates the directory with `mkdir -p .claude/audits` on first write.
- The toolkit does NOT auto-add `.claude/audits/` to `.gitignore` — let the user decide which audit reports to commit.

---

### Type Slug to Prompt File Map

| `/audit` argument | Report filename slug | Prompt loaded |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| `security` | `security` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/SECURITY_AUDIT.md` |
| `code-review` | `code-review` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/CODE_REVIEW.md` |
| `performance` | `performance` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` |
| `deploy-checklist` | `deploy-checklist` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` |
| `mysql-performance` | `mysql-performance` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/MYSQL_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` |
| `postgres-performance` | `postgres-performance` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/POSTGRES_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` |
| `design-review` | `design-review` | `templates/<framework>/prompts/DESIGN_REVIEW.md` |

Backward-compat aliases: `code` resolves to `code-review` and `deploy` resolves to `deploy-checklist` at dispatch time. The report filename ALWAYS uses the canonical slug, never the alias.

---

### YAML Frontmatter

Every report opens with a YAML frontmatter block containing exactly these 7 keys:

```yaml
---
audit_type: security
timestamp: "2026-04-25-1730"
commit_sha: a1b2c3d
total_findings: 3
skipped_allowlist: 1
skipped_fp_recheck: 2
council_pass: pending
---
```

- `audit_type` — one of the 7 canonical slugs from the type map.
- `timestamp` — quoted `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM` (the same string used in the report filename).
- `commit_sha` — `git rev-parse --short HEAD` output, or the literal string `none` when the project is not a git repo.
- `total_findings` — integer count of entries in the `## Findings` section.
- `skipped_allowlist` — integer count of rows in the `## Skipped (allowlist)` table.
- `skipped_fp_recheck` — integer count of rows in the `## Skipped (FP recheck)` table.
- `council_pass` — starts at `pending`. Phase 15's `/council audit-review` mutates this to `passed`, `failed`, or `disputed` after collating per-finding verdicts.

---

### Section Order (Fixed)

After the YAML frontmatter, the report MUST contain these five H2 sections in this exact order:

1. `## Summary`
2. `## Findings`
3. `## Skipped (allowlist)`
4. `## Skipped (FP recheck)`
5. `## Council verdict`

Plus the report's title H1 (`# <Type Title> Audit — <project name>`) immediately after the closing `---` of the frontmatter and before `## Summary`.

Do NOT reorder. Do NOT introduce intermediate H2 sections. Render an empty section as the literal placeholder `_None_` — the allowlist case uses a longer placeholder shown verbatim in the Skipped (allowlist) section below. Phase 15 navigates by these literal H2 headings.

---

### Summary Section

The Summary table has columns `severity | count_reported | count_skipped_allowlist | count_skipped_fp_recheck`, with one row per severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). The rubric is in `components/severity-levels.md` — do not redefine. INFO is NOT a reportable finding severity; informational observations belong in the audit's scratchpad, never in `## Findings`. See the Full Report Skeleton below for the verbatim layout.

---

### Finding Entry Schema (### Finding F-NNN)

Each surviving finding becomes an `### Finding F-NNN` H3 block. `F-NNN` is zero-padded to 3 digits and sequential per report (`F-001`, `F-002`, ...).

The entry has 11 fields rendered in two presentation styles:

- **Bullet-label fields (1–7):** rendered as `**<Label>:**` bullets immediately under the H3, in the order shown below.
- **Section-block fields (8–11):** rendered as `**<Label>:**` paragraph headings, each followed by its block (code fence, list, prose, or diff).

The fields appear in this exact order:

1. **ID** — the `F-NNN` identifier matching the H3 heading.
2. **Severity** — one of CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW (per `components/severity-levels.md`).
3. **Confidence** — one of HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW. HIGH = directly observable in code with a clear execution path; MEDIUM = strong evidence with some inferred assumptions; LOW = weak signal or incomplete evidence. LOW-confidence findings MUST explicitly state the uncertainty in `Why it is real`. (Note: Confidence and Severity share the tokens HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW; the bullet label disambiguates — never write a bare `HIGH` without its `**Severity:**` or `**Confidence:**` label.)
4. **Category** — one of: Correctness, Business Logic, Reliability, Concurrency, Performance, Operational Reliability, Operational Maintainability Risk, API Contract, Data Integrity, Security, Data Exposure. (Audit-type prompts MAY restrict this enum further — see the prompt's own `## Category` constraint, if any.)
5. **Rule** — the auditor's rule-id (e.g. `SEC-SQL-INJECTION`, `PERF-N+1`, `LOG-INVERTED-COND`, `DATA-PARTIAL-UPDATE`).
6. **Location** — `<path>:<start>-<end>` for a range, or `<path>:<line>` for a single point.
7. **Claim** — one-sentence statement of the alleged issue, ≤ 160 chars.
8. **Code** — verbatim ±10 lines around the flagged line, fenced with the language matching the source extension (see Verbatim Code Block section).
9. **Data flow** — markdown bullet list tracing input from origin to the flagged sink, ≤ 6 hops.
10. **Why it is real** — 2-4 sentences citing concrete tokens visible in the Code block. This field is what the Council reasons from in Phase 15.
11. **Suggested fix** — diff-style hunk or replacement snippet showing the corrected pattern.

Field omission rules (the omission key is **Severity**, never Confidence):

- **Severity = CRITICAL / HIGH** — all 11 fields required.
- **Severity = MEDIUM** — MAY omit Data flow and Suggested fix when they add no value. Confidence remains required (default `Confidence: MEDIUM` if not stated).
- **Severity = LOW** — MAY collapse to ID + Severity + Confidence + Location + Claim + one-line evidence (the Code / Data flow / Why it is real / Suggested fix sections may be merged into the Claim).

Note: omission rules apply per **Severity**. A LOW-severity finding with HIGH confidence may collapse; a HIGH-severity finding with LOW confidence MUST keep all 11 fields (LOW confidence requires the uncertainty be explicit, which lives in `Why it is real`).

See the Full Report Skeleton below for the verbatim entry template (a SQL-INJECTION example demonstrating all required fields).

The bullet labels (`**Severity:**`, `**Confidence:**`, `**Category:**`, `**Rule:**`, `**Location:**`, `**Claim:**`) and section labels (`**Code:**`, `**Data flow:**`, `**Why it is real:**`, `**Suggested fix:**`) are byte-exact — Phase 15's Council parser navigates the entry by them.

---

### Verbatim Code Block (AUDIT-03)

#### Layout

```text
<!-- File: <path> Lines: <start>-<end> -->
[optional clamp note]
[fenced code block here with <lang> from the Extension Map]
```

`<lang>` is the language fence selected per the Extension to Language Fence Map below. `start = max(1, L - 10)` and `end = min(T, L + 10)` where `L` is the flagged line and `T` is the total line count of the file. The HTML range comment is the FIRST line above the fence; the clamp note (when present) is the SECOND line above the fence.

#### Clamp Behaviour

When the ±10 range is clipped by the start or end of the file, emit a `<!-- Range clamped to file bounds (start-end) -->` note immediately above the fenced block. Example: flagged line 5 in an 8-line file → `start = max(1, 5-10) = 1`, `end = min(8, 5+10) = 8`, rendered range `1-8`, clamp note required.

#### Extension to Language Fence Map

| Extension(s) | Fence |
|--------------|-------|
| `.ts`, `.tsx` | `ts` (or `tsx` for JSX-bearing files) |
| `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` | `js` |
| `.py` | `python` |
| `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh` | `bash` |
| `.rb` | `ruby` |
| `.go` | `go` |
| `.php` | `php` |
| `.md` | `markdown` |
| `.yml`, `.yaml` | `yaml` |
| `.json` | `json` |
| `.toml` | `toml` |
| `.html`, `.htm` | `html` |
| `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass` | `css` |
| `.sql` | `sql` |
| `.rs` | `rust` |
| `.java` | `java` |
| `.kt`, `.kts` | `kotlin` |
| `.swift` | `swift` |
| *unknown* | `text` |

The code block MUST be verbatim — no ellipses, no redaction, no `// ... rest of function` cuts. Council reasons from the actual code, not a paraphrase.

---

### Skipped (allowlist) Section

Columns: `ID | path:line | rule | council_status`. Empty-state placeholder is the literal string `_None — no` followed by a backtick-quoted `audit-exceptions.md` reference and `in this project_`. The verbatim layout is in the Full Report Skeleton below.

`council_status` is parsed from the matching entry's `**Council:**` bullet inside `audit-exceptions.md`. Allowed values: `unreviewed`, `council_confirmed_fp`, `disputed`. Use `sed '/^<!--/,/^-->/d'` (per `commands/audit-restore.md` post-13-05 fix) to strip HTML comment blocks before walking entries — the seed file ships with an HTML-commented example heading that would otherwise produce false matches. The `F-A001`..`F-ANNN` numbering is independent of `F-NNN` for surviving findings.

---

### Skipped (FP recheck) Section

Columns: `path:line | rule | dropped_at_step | one_line_reason`. Empty-state placeholder: `_None_`. The verbatim layout is in the Full Report Skeleton below.

`dropped_at_step` MUST be an integer in 1-6 matching the FP-recheck step where the finding was dropped (see `components/audit-fp-recheck.md`). `one_line_reason` MUST be ≤ 100 chars and reference concrete tokens visible in the source — never `looks fine`, `trusted code`, or `out of scope`.

---

### Council Verdict Slot (handoff to Phase 15)

The audit writes this section as a literal placeholder. Phase 15's `/council audit-review` mutates it in place after collating Gemini + ChatGPT verdicts.

```markdown
## Council verdict

_pending — run /council audit-review_
```

Byte-exact constraints: U+2014 em-dash (literal `—`, not hyphen-minus, not en-dash); single-underscore italic (`_..._`), no asterisks; no backticks, no bold, no code fence, no trailing whitespace. DO NOT REFORMAT — Phase 15 greps for this exact byte sequence to locate the slot before rewriting it.

---

### Full Report Skeleton

The skeleton below uses a SECURITY finding (SQL injection) as the
illustrative example. For other audit types substitute the appropriate
`audit_type`, H1 title, finding `Category` (e.g. Correctness for
code-review, Performance for performance, Reliability for design-review),
and `Rule` namespace. The schema (field order, byte-exact bullet labels,
section order, Council slot string) is identical across all 7 audit
types.

# Security Audit — claude-code-toolkit

## Summary

| severity | count_reported | count_skipped_allowlist | count_skipped_fp_recheck |
|----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| HIGH | 1 | 1 | 1 |

## Findings

### Finding F-001

- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Category:** Security
- **Rule:** SEC-SQL-INJECTION
- **Location:** src/users.ts:42
- **Claim:** User-supplied id flows into a string-concatenated SQL query without parameterization.

**Code:**

[fenced code block here — verbatim ±10 lines around src/users.ts:42, ts language fence]

**Data flow:**

- `req.params.id` arrives from the HTTP route handler.
- Passed unchanged into `db.query()`.
- No parameterized binding between origin and sink.

**Why it is real:**

The literal `db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + req.params.id)` concatenates an Express request parameter directly into the SQL string. The route is public, so an attacker can supply a malicious id and reach the sink unauthenticated.

**Suggested fix:**

[fenced code block here — replacement using parameterized query]

## Council Handoff
<!-- v42-splice: council-handoff -->

When the structured report is complete, hand it off to the Supreme Council for
peer review. See `commands/audit.md` Phase 5 (Council Pass — mandatory) for the
invocation: `/council audit-review --report <path>`. The Council runs in
audit-review mode (see `commands/council.md` `## Modes`). The Council verdict
slot in the report is pre-populated with the byte-exact placeholder
`_pending — run /council audit-review_` (U+2014 em-dash) and is overwritten by
the Council pass.
